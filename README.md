# Patient cards Triage

Welcome to our new **coding challenge**.
During this session of ~4-6h, we will evaluate your code skills on multiple aspects of the front end world!!
It is important to read all the instructions before to start your chrono ⏱!,
Note: Please remember to send us the time spent on this Homework.

## Instructions
We are trying to build a Triage Patient's cards that can move cards from the TODO column to the DONE column
- Fetch the patient cards using our local server
- Display the patient cards in the corresponding column (_Pending_ + _Rejected_ and _Done_)
- Allow user to change the card status from _Pending_ or _Rejected_ to _Done_ and from _Done_ to _Rejected_.
- Add a local filtering by patient name and arrhythmias.

A particular attention will be taken to your Code Structure, your ability to express data models and UX-UI components structure.

## Requirements
You can choose **any** of the following solution, but we expect to have a clean file structure on your final project.

Set up your project with one of our project CLI recommendations
- Angular [cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
- React [reactApp](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- VueJS [vuecli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
- Vanilla

Of course, you are free to use any of the **CSS naming** convention / methodology, or any **testing** libraries other than the one provided by the CLI.

## Design specs
Because no feature is developed without a nice pseudo-design, here is a quick sketch of how we think we can display the list.

> Let's Go, Let's express your **creativity** !!

## Bonus points
Bonus points given for :

- UI/UX design
- Writing unit tests
- CSS animations
- Using Typescript

Don't forget to give us your feedback on this Homework, we will be more than happy to make a Version 2.

## Server, How to use it
Here is a simple instruction on how to set up your local server for the project

1. First install the node dependencies
   `npm install`

2. Run the local API server
   `npm run api`

3. With everything set up, you can now access the list of cards with the following URL:
   `GET http://localhost:3000/cards`

## Share your project
Create a new GitHub project and share your work with us
If you are using a private repository on GitHub, add us as a collaborator (`buenjybar`, `baptooo` and `ArthurFoucher`) so we can read your code

## Good Luck and HAVE FUN!!
